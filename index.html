          <b>Overview </b>
          <p>
            I believe that improving the search and booking process for people
            who will travel, will improve their understanding of using the
            booking app for booking flights.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore users are more likely to finish the booking process which
            will reduce the number of cart abandonments for the booking app.

        Because we wanted to get insights and form a solution from a real-time

        who are frequent air travellers, some of which were customers of the

          We looked into the market to examine other airlines, carried out a

          We thought to pull from other working applications and thier already

          understanding and check out the what already worked for these other
          airlines in order to save us from re-designig from scratch. so i
          pulled insights from the top (3) three domestic airlines in Nigeria
          which are Arik, Dana and Aero contractors.

        <b class="text-red">Validating Product ideas with User Testing</b>
        <p>
          We led a few moderated usability tests focusing on air travellers that
          frequently booked their own flights on a travel site. We tried to find
          out how users responded to the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.) We used Zoom and Google meet to conduct remote usability tests,
          due to long distances it was not possible to conduct face to face
          usability testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.) The users were people that frequently booked their own flights on
          a travel site
        </p>
        <p>
          3.) We presented the mobile app design and gave them a set of
          pre-defined tasks including to book a return flight from Lagos to Cape
          any destination of thier choice for 2 adults for 7 days.

          <b>1.) Working on cross functional teams</b>
          <p>
            Working on this project was my first experience collaborating with
            Product Managers and Software Engineers in a cross-functional
            setting. This experience exposed me to what it’s like to tackle my
            role as a Product Designer while also putting myself in the shoes of
            Product Managers and Software Engineers. For example, many of my
            initial iterations included designs that would make intricate
            programs that would be difficult for engineers to develop. While I
            didn’t understand these issues at first, Engineers and Product
            Managers helped me better understand why certain designs wouldn’t be
            feasible.
          </p>
          <b>2.) Time management/Prioritizing </b>
          <p>
            I learned how important it is to pick your battles when it comes to
            designing a product. During the ideation period, we came up with a
            variety of ideas to solve the problems we found in our research.
            Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to design every idea with
            the 48 hours we had. This situation helped me understand how to
            prioritize the most important aspects of a design.
